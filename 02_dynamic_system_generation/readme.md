# Dynamic System Generator Test

This folder contains a small Godot project that dynamically creates a star system from JSON data. At runtime it will:
- load the base system scene
- Instantiate a planet with a unique position, sprite, and background
- The planet you can land on/take off and will have a different background/ui options
